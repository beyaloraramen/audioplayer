# Music Player JS

This project is a simple **music player** built with vanilla JavaScript. The audio files and metadata are stored on GitHub, and the metadata is accessed via a `metadata.json` file.

## Features

- Fetches audio files and metadata from GitHub
- Displays song information such as title, artist, album, etc.
- Play/pause functionality
- Volume and seek control
- Support for playlists

## How it Works

1. **Audio Files**: All audio files are uploaded to the `audio/` directory in this repository.
2. **Metadata**: Song information such as title, artist, album, etc., is stored in a `metadata.json` file.
3. **JavaScript**: JavaScript is used to fetch both the metadata and audio files from GitHub and load them into the player.
